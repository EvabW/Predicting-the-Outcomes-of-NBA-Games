# Business-Intelligence-
During our studies at the Rennes School of Business, our group (Evan Winter, Jamison Stutsman, Nicholas Perry, Baylor Van Sickle) used ARTIFICIAL INTELLEGENCE and coding to build a predictive model that determines the outcome of NBA Games with an accuracy of 90% and an F-1 Score of 91%. This model is trained over 26,000 data points from 2003 - 2022
